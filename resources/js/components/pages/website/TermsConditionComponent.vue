                            contact from prospective employers and recruiters about opportunities which match the work
                            seekers’ fields of interest. If you are a work seeker we will therefore make your personal

                            ability to control the extent to which your personal data is shared with other recruiters
                            and prospective employers through the contact preferences section of the “MyPage” section on
                            the Website. For job seekers, we will use your personal data to provide you with the
                            recruitment services that we provide, to manage your account and to email you about
